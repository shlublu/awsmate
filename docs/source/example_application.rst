Example application
===================

An example application is provided in the Github repository of this library.
To deploy it or to modify it for experimentation, you can download the repository in one of the following ways:

* using git: ``git clone https://github.com/shlublu/awsmate.git``
* manually: ``zip`` and ``tar.gz`` archives are available on the `release page of the repository <https://github.com/shlublu/awsmate/releases>`_

Prerequisites
-------------

To deploy and run this application, you will need:

* an AWS account with valid credentials to create, modify and destroy AWS resources
* a Linux shell able to use ``curl`` and ``unzip``. This can either be a native one or a Cygwin or equivalent should you be using Windows.

Instructions for deployment
---------------------------

Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Using configuration and credentials files:
    *   Define a default profile in ``~/.aws/``, or use the AWS CLI ``aws configure`` command
    *   Please see the `AWS documentation of these configuration files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html>`_  for further details
* Using environment variables: 
    *   Define the environment variables ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``, ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``, (...) with the parameters corresponding to your AWS IAM credentials 
    *   Export them all using the shell ``export`` command
    *   Please see the `AWS documentation of these environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html>`_  for further details

Depending on your AWS IAM setup, you may have to use the AWS CLI to execute commands such as ``aws sts assume-role`` or ``aws sso login`` on top of the above.

.. _Deployment:

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

From the ``example`` directory seen above:

* edit the file ``variables.tfvars`` to define the AWS Region you wish to deploy in. The default configuration is ``aws_region = "eu-west-1"``
* run ``./deploy.sh``: this will deploy all AWS resources described in the ``tf/`` directory. This may take some time, and this produces a pretty verbose log.
* then take note of the final log message ``endpoint_url = "https://<deployment id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/v0"``: this is the base URL of the newly deployed example API. 

The :ref:`section "Application users's guide" <UsersGuide>` below explains how to use this example application.

**Caveats**: 

This API is accessible from the whole internet to anyone who would find its URL, so we recommend undeploying the example application after 
use (see :ref:`section "Undeployment" <Undeployment>` below). This URL is generated by AWS at deployment time so there is no risk to see it memorized by anybody.

Should you modify the API Gateway routes or parameters defined in ``tf/03-apigateway.tf`` to experiment on your own, the API Gateway AWS resources will need redeploying.
Using the ``./deploy.sh`` script will not be enough to do so as Terraform is able to modify the API Gateway resources but not to redeploy them on a AWS standpoint. 
You will need to redeploy the API gateway using the AWS console or the AWS CLI before continuing to use the example application, otherwise unexpected behaviour may 
occur such as unexpected messages ``{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}`` when querying the API. 
You can also undeploy the application (see :ref:`section "Undeployment" <Undeployment>` below) before deploying it again using ``./deploy.sh``. This would work 
perfectly but this would change the ``endpoint_url``. 

.. _Undeployment:

Undeployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the ``example`` directory above, run:

* ``./undeploy.sh``: this will destroy all AWS resources created by ``./deploy.sh``. This may take some time.

* Use

    The ``<endpoint_url>`` placeholder below need replacing by the actual value returned by ``./deploy.sh``, as seen in :ref:`section "Deployment" <Deployment>` above.

    * Route "okay": ``lambda_apigateway_returns_okay.py``
        * Command-line with ``curl`` 
            * ``curl -v -X <method> https://<endpoint_url>/okay/<any path>?<any url parameter>=<any value> --data '<any JSON payload>' --header '<any name>: <any value>'`` 
            * Example: ``curl -v -X POST https://<endpoint_url>/okay/lets/go?someParam=someValue --data '{ "someKey": 42 }' --header 'X-example: 42'``
            * Returns 200 with a JSON payload that contains the result of all methods of ``awsmate.apigateway.LambdaProxyEvent`` plus the raw event received from AWS API Gateway.
            * Demonstrates
                * the use of all methods of :class:`awsmate.apigateway.LambdaProxyEvent`,
                * the use of the HTTP response builder :func:`awsmate.apigateway.build_http_response`
            * Tip: play with the ``Accept`` and ``Accept-Encoding`` headers, play with the routes, play with the URL parameters
        * With a web browser
            * ``https://<endpoint_url>/okay/<any path>?<any url parameter>=<any value>``
            * Example: ``https://<endpoint_url>/okay/lets/go?someParam=someValue``
            * Returns an HTML page that is an HTML transformation of the JSON payload described in the command-line example just above.
            * Demonstrates 
                * the same of the above, plus
                * the use of the ``custom_transformers`` (here: HTML transformation of the API response) described in :doc:`the apigateway module documentation <apigateway>`,
                * the use of ``extra_headers`` (here: to handle CORS) with :func:`awsmate.apigateway.build_http_response`,
                * the ``gzip`` built-in functionality of :func:`awsmate.apigateway.build_http_response` based on the ``Accept-Encoding`` header (unless your browser does not accept gzip!),
                * the handling of preferences submitted through ``Accept*`` headers in `weighted quality value syntax <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation>`_.
            * Tip: think of how you could localize the returned content depending on the ``Accept-Language`` header submitted by the browser
    * Route "forbidden": ``lambda_apigateway_returns_403.py``
        * Command-line with ``curl`` 
            * ``curl -v -X GET https://<endpoint_url>/forbidden' --header '<any name>: <any value>'`` 
            * Example: ``curl -v -X GET https://<endpoint_url>/forbidden``
            * Returns 403 with a JSON payload that explains the access is forbidden
            * Logs an error message in AWS Cloudwatch. See :ref:`section "Logger features" <LoggerFeatures>` below for further details.
            * Demonstrates
                * the use of the HTTP response builder :func:`awsmate.apigateway.build_http_client_error_response`
        * With a web browser
            * ``https://<endpoint_url>/forbidden``
            * Example: ``https://<endpoint_url>/forbidden``
            * Returns an HTML page that is an HTML transformation of the JSON payload described in the command-line example just above.
            * Demonstrates 
                * the same of the above plus the same extras seen with the "okay" route above
    * Route "crash": ``lambda_apigateway_returns_500.py``
        * Command-line with ``curl`` 
            * ``curl -v -X GET https://<endpoint_url>/crash' --header '<any name>: <any value>'`` 
            * Example: ``curl -v -X GET https://<endpoint_url>/crash``
            * Returns 500 with a JSON payload that explains an internal error occurred
            * Logs a complete stack trace in AWS Cloudwatch. See :ref:`section "Logger features" <LoggerFeatures>` below for further details.
            * Demonstrates
                * the use of the HTTP response builder :func:`awsmate.apigateway.build_http_server_error_response` 
                * how not to reveal the cause of the crash to the end user (which would be a security breach) while logging it for debugging purposes
        * With a web browser
            * ``https://<endpoint_url>/crash``
            * Example: ``https://<endpoint_url>/crash``
            * Returns an HTML page that is an HTML transformation of the JSON payload described in the command-line example just above.
            * Demonstrates 
                * the same of the above plus the same extras seen with the "okay" route above
